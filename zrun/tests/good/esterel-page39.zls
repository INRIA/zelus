      "We first start analyzing what the “signal S” statement must do
      with status ⊥ for O. For this, we analyze its body with status
      ⊥ for O and S. We immediately find that S must be emitted since
      we must execute the “emit S” statement. Therefore, we redo the
      analysis with status ⊥ for O and + for S. We reach the test for
      O. Since the status of O is unknown, there is nothing we must do
      and we can make progress only by analyzing what we cannot do in
      the branches of the test. In the then branch, there is a present
      test for S. Since S is known to be present, we cannot take the
      implicit else branch that would terminate. Since the then branch
      is a pause statement, it cannot terminate. Summing up things,
      the “present S” test cannot termi- nate. Therefore, the “emit O”
      statement cannot be executed and O cannot be emitted. As a
      consequence we must set O absent and redo the analysis of the
      program with status − for O. We now find that we must take the
      im- plicit else branch of the “present O” test that terminates
      execution. The program is constructive since we have fully
      determined the signal statuses."
