Modelisation of a mass with a spring, with a complex friction model : 
when the mass is in motion the friction is a classic fluid damping force.
But when the mass is static the force tends to be greater. (Cf PDF file for more details)

Automaton between the two states : Sliding and Stuck

The results aren't so close from those of simulink (in particular on "flat areas" of the x curve). I don't know why yet.
