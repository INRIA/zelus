This directory contains the values calculated by Simulink during the Clutch
Engagement simulation using Stateflow (sf_clutch.mdl) between 0.0 and 10.0.

Results were obtained for three sets of simulation parameters:

* ode23 (default)
  Variable-step
  ode23 (Bogacki-Shampine)

  step size
    max:     auto
    min:     auto
    initial: auto

  relative tolerance: 1e-6
  absolute tolerance: 1e-7

  zero-crossings
    time tolerance: 10*128*eps
    algorithm: nonadaptive
    number of consecutive: 1000

* ode45
  Variable-step
  ode45 (Dormand-Prince)

  step size
    max:     auto
    min:     auto
    initial: auto

  relative tolerance: 1e-6
  absolute tolerance: 1e-7

  zero-crossings
    time tolerance: 10*128*eps
    algorithm: nonadaptive
    number of consecutive: 1000

* ode3
  Fixed-step
  ode3 (Bogacki-Shampine)
  Fixed-step size: 0.1

For each run there are three files:
    <solver>_in.mat	time/tin/tfmaxs/tfmaxk
    <solver>_out.mat	time/engine/vehicle/shaft
    <solver>.out	time/tin/tfmaxs/tfmaxk/engine/vehicle/shaft

    (tin = engine torque, tfmaxk = kinetic friction, tfmaxs = static friction)

The last is a tab-delimited text file produced from the first two via:
    ../../../tools/mat_to_text \
	--titles "Tin,Tfmaxs,Tfmaxk,Engine,Vehicle,Shaft" \
	<solver>_in.mat <solver>_out.mat > <solver>.out

These values can be plotted (via gnuplot) using a script:
    ./plot_clutch <solver>.out

Or just by typing: make
