## Backhoe ##

!REQUIRES: Lablgtk2

The Backhoe loader is an [original
example](http://www.tbrk.org/esterel/backhoe.html) that we developed to
teach reactive programming.

![Backhoe control loop](img/backhoeloop.png "Backhoe loop")

The model comprises two interconnected elements:

 * a continuous model of the plant (parts of the backhoe)
 * a discrete controller

The original programming challenge focused on the discrete controller, but
expressing the continuous dynamics is also an interesting programming
problem, as is interfacing the two models.

![Backhoe model: sensor names and locations](img/backhoesensors.png "Backhoe sensor names")

The discrete controller receives input from sensors which are defined inside
the continuous model. There are sensors for each of three buttons
(`stop_button`, `extend_button`, and `retract_button`), for indicating
whether the legs are fully retracted (`legs_in`) or fully extended
(`legs_out`), and for indicating whether each of the rear segments is fully
retracted (`*_in`) or fully extended (`*_out`).

There are control signals for three lamps (`alarm_lamp`, `done_lamp`, and
`cancel_lamp`) and for triggering leg extension (`legs_extend`), leg
retraction (`legs_retract`), and stopping leg motion (`legs_step`). There
are three control signals pel segment: setting an internal valve for pushing
(`*_push`), or for pulling (`*_pull`), and for driving hydraulic fluid
through the valve (`*_drive`). It is assumed that a lower-level controller
maintains a segments position when it is not being driven.

![Backhoe segment model](img/backhoesegmentauto.png "Backhoe segment model")

Each segment is modelled using set of equations that include a hybrid
automaton. Two types of dynamics are modelled: moving and stopping with
momentum (modelled as a Proportional-Integral controller) and bouncing at
the limits of movement (modelled as instantaneous reset).
