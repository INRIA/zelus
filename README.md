# Zelus: A Synchronous Language with ODEs

Zélus is a synchronous language extended with Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to program hybrid systems that mix discrete-time and continuous-time models.
An example is a (discrete-time) model of a control software paired with a (continuous-time) model of the plant.
The language shares the basic principles of the synchronous languages [Lustre](https://www-verimag.imag.fr/DIST-TOOLS/SYNCHRONE/lustre-v6/) with modularity features from [Lucid Synchrone](http://www.di.ens.fr/~pouzet/lucid-synchrone/) (type inference, hierarchical automata, and higher-order functions).
It is conservatively extended to write continuous-time models expressed by ODEs and zero-crossing events.
The compiler is written in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) and is structured as a series of source-to-source and traceable transformations that ultimately yield statically scheduled sequential code.
Continuous-time models are simulated using an off-the-shelf numerical solver (here [Sundials CVODE](https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/description/description.html#descr_cvode) and, for the moment, the two built-in solvers ode23 and ode45).

## Getting Started

The easiest way to install Zelus is via [Opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/), the OCaml package manager.

```
$ opam install zelus
```

You can then test your installation with:
```
$ zeluc -version
```

The manual, examples, and research papers can be found at http://zelus.di.ens.fr

### Optional Dependencies

By default Zelus relies on the built-in solvers.
To switch to Sundials CVODE you need to install sundialsml (which requires sundials).
Some examples also depend on the zelus gtk library (which requires gtk2.0)

```
$ opam install sundialsml zelus-gtk
```

### Docker

We also provide a dockerfile to setup an environment with all the dependencies.
Build the image with (you might need to increase available memory in docker preferences):
```
$ make docker-build
```

Run with:
```
$ make docker-run
```


##  A Simple Example

Consider the example of a bouncing ball.
The zelus code is the following:

```ocaml
let loose = 0.8
let     g = 9.81
let    x0 = 0.0 
let    y0 = 10.0
let   x'0 = 1.0
let   y'0 = 0.0

let hybrid main () = () where
  rec der x  =  x' init x0
  and der y  =  y' init y0
  and der x' = 0.0 init x'0
  and der y' = -.g init y'0 reset up(-.y) -> -.loose *. last y'
  and present up(-.y) -> local cpt in
    do  cpt = 0 fby cpt + 1
    and  () = print_endline (string_of_int cpt) done
```

The dynamics of the ball is expressed with four ODEs defining the position `(x, y)` and the speed `(x', y')` of the ball given an initial position `(x0, y0)` and an initial speed `(x'0, y'0)`.
Whenever the ball hits the ground `up(-. y)` the discrete time code of the body of the `present` construct is executed (here incrementing a simple counter).

### Compilation

The zeluc compiler takes a zelus file (e.g., `bouncing.zls`) and compile it to OCaml code (e.g., `bouncing.ml`).

```
$ zeluc bouncing.zls
```

You can also specify a simulation node.
The compiler then generates an additional file containing the simulation code (e.g., `main.ml`).

```
$ zeluc -s main bouncing.zls
```

To build an executable, the last thing to do is to compile the OCaml code using the `zelus` library.

```
$ ocamlfind ocamlc -linkpkg -package zelus bouncing.ml main.ml -o bouncing
```

## Other Examples

This repository includes runnable examples demonstrating different aspects of the language. 
The source code for several of the examples can be found in the `examples` directory.
To build most of the examples:

```
$ cd examples && make
```

The executables can be found in each example directory (e.g., `horloge/horloge_main.exe`).

## Development (inslallation from the sources)

### First, you need to install [opam] (https://opam.ocaml.org) and
[dune] (https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Install sundials <= 6.1 (https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/sundials-software).
Install sundialsml 6.1 from the source (https://inria-parkas.github.io/sundialsml/). 
Warning: as of Nov. 2023, sundialsml only works with sundials <= 6.1. We hare
working on updating it with the latest version. Moreover, sundialsml only works with OCaml up to version 4.14.1. It does not work yet with OCaml version >= 5.0.

Everything should work then!

### Compiler

We use [dune](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to build the compiler, the libraries, and the examples.
To build the project:

```
$ ./configure
$ dune build
```

This produces two executables (and some tools in `./tools`):
- `compiler/zeluc.exe`: native code
- `compiler/zeluc.bc`: byte code (can be used with ocamldebug)

Libraries are split in two packages:
- `zelus`: the standard libraries
- `zelus-gtk`: additional libraries that depend on lablgtk (only built if lablgtk is installed)

The build automatically detects if sundialsml is installed and updates the librairies accordingly.

The main Makefile contains useful commands to build the project of install zelus as an opam development package from source.

```
$ make help
Usage:
  make all                 #  Build the compiler and libraries
  make test                #  Launch the tests via dune
  make examples            #  Build all the examples
  make tools               #  Build the tools
  make install             #  Install as an opam development package pinned to this directory
  make uninstall           #  Remove opam pin
  make clean               #  Clean the entire project
  make docker-build        #  Build the Docker image
  make docker-run          #  Launch a terminal in the Docker image
  make help                #  Print this help
```

### Test

To run all the tests you can use dune. 

```
$ dune runtest
```

Or alternatively, the Makefile of the test directory.

```
$ cd test
$ make
```

Tests are split into 3 categories: `good`, `bad`, and `run`.
To launch a single subset (e.g., `good`):
```
$ cd good
$ make
```

To clean generated files:
```
$ make clean
```
