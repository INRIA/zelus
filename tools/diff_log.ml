(* #! /usr/bin/env ocamlscript *)

(*
 * Reads two data files; the first column in each containing the time and each
 * having the same number of columns. Returns a new datafile containing the
 * differences between corresponding columns against the time. The resulting
 * sample times are the union of the sample times from both files. Linear
 * interpolation is used to approximate values at instants that are sampled in
 * one file but not the other.
 *
 * Use to compare the outputs of simulation runs made using different systems or
 * solvers.
