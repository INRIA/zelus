(* TEST[-check 20] *)

(* Check for a simultaneous reset of two derivatives by a pair-valued signal
   whose value is returned by a function. Compare to t0024.ls without the
   function call.

   Expected behaviour of x: a sawtooth signal, rising from -1 to 0 with a slope
   of 1, then being reset to -1 and starting again.

   Expected behaviour of y: a sawtooth signal, rising from -2 to -1 with a slope
   of 1, then being reset to -2 and starting again.
     
   Both signals are sampled at 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, ... when x should be
   (approximately) equal to -0.5 and y should be (approximately) equal to -1.5.
